To-do List
------------
1. check and fix errors in console
2. delete extra code in app.js and index.css
3. fix width issue
4. dynamically create html for car lists using object
5. word shop on gradient is cut off  
6. separate components into their own files (yes you need to that file is so huge silly)

Style Suggestions 
------------------
(read all and decide what you want to do before starting)

1. magnifine glass search button styling 
2. slight space before | between nav words at top right 
3. add actual icon instead of c in nav
4. support link li only has margin on one side making it different
5. get rid of white space around full width image
6. get rid of hr separating the sections use whitespace instead or style the hr (look it up there are many ways)
7. get rid of one of the greybk10 (id recommend getting rid of second)
8. choose only one car to keep so it doesn't get squished (id recommend the silver one)
9. get rid of white space and lord has done it (or relocate it)
10. make car list centered
11. change 50% off radius to be further from the 5 
12. remove border around pagination 
13. make top/bottom padding of footer even
14. get rid of stuff under footer
15. personally dont like two nav areas 
16. get rid of search (just add an actual car search by shop) 

Other Suggestions
-------------------
1. Dynamic search by model etc or by clicking on models like gilroytoyota.components
    (I can help you :) )
2. Make website responsive with screen sizes
    (this will take a lot of work but is pretty important)


Todo Details
==============================

Details for Item 3
------------------
check items that are full width 
100vw is unnecessary use 100% instead

change those 3 lines of code then you notice an improvement 
but problem remains

next to greybk there is a little white space to the right so that is 
no longer causing problems

inspect the full width elements to see where the problem is

hint: margin is not counted in box-sizing: border-box so that will add space

answer!!
--the image that is full width has a margin fix this and problem solved :D
